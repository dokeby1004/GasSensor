# Introduction

## Gas Sensor

RNSLab Co., Ltd. continues to develop gas sensors and is releasing various products.

The **RSM411** is a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems \(MEMS\) based Air Quality Sensor which offers miniaturization and low power consumption. It can detect the gaseous air contaminants \(CO / Ethanol / HCHO / etc.\). 

The **RSM711, RSM712, RSM741** is a metal oxide semiconductor type sensor in which a sensor layer and a heater layer are formed on an alumina substrate. In the sensor, the sensing materials are placed on the alumina substrate, and the resistance of the sensing material is varied according to the concentration of the air pollution gases. 



The following documents describe in detail the main functions and features of each Gas sensor product.
