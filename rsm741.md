## 4. Description

The RSM741 is a metal oxide semiconductor type sensor in which a sensor layer and a heater layer are formed on an alumina substrate. It can detect the methane \(CH4\) gas In the sensor, the sensing materials are placed on the alumina substrate , and the resistance of the sensing material is varied according to the concentration of the methane \(CH4\) gas The RSM741 is fabricated on the TO-5 package with several holes. It can reduce the influence of interference gases as well as protect from humidity or dust.
